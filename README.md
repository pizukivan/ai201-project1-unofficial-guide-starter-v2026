# Unit 1

## What This Does

<!-- Three or four sentences. Which corpus you picked, and the kinds of
     questions your system answers. Write it for someone who has never seen
     this repo.

     Milestone 5. --> This is an retrieval-augmented Q&A system over the corpus campus_life, it answers specific single fact questions as well a questions that need two documents combined. Every answer names it's source document, and questions outside of the corpus are refused rather than guessed at. 

## Chunking Strategy

**Chunk size:** 400
**Overlap:** 0

<!-- What about YOUR documents made you pick these numbers? Short posts and
     long sectioned guides don't want the same chunking, and "800 seemed
     reasonable" earns nothing. Point at something you noticed when you read
     the documents in Milestone 1.

     If you changed your mind partway through, say so and say why. That's worth
     more than pretending you got it right first time.

     Milestone 3. --> The longest document on campus_life is 550 so at 800 every document became exactly one chunk. I tried splitting on every "." but that was cutting values like GPA or currency, so I decided to chunk in full sentences up to 400 characters, that way no sentence gets cut and we loose context. 

## Sample Chunks

<!-- Five chunks, pasted as text. Label each one and name the file it came from
     AND the function that produced it — the grader checks your code against
     what you claim here.

     `python app.py chunks -n 5` prints all three for you. Copy them straight
     across.

     Milestone 3. -->
======================================================================
**Chunk 1**  |  source: admin_add_drop_deadline.txt#0  |  produced by: chunker.py::split_documents
======================================================================
On the add/drop deadline

You can add a course through the end of the second week. Dropping is a longer window — through the end of week six — but a drop after week two shows as a W on your transcript. Nothing anywhere on the registrar's site says this plainly, and students find out from each other.

======================================================================
**Chunk 2**  |  source: course_cs_210.txt#0  |  produced by: chunker.py::split_documents
======================================================================
CS 210 Data Structures

I'm a junior and I've done this twice now. Format is lecture with weekly labs; slides go up after class, not before. Assessment: two midterms and a final, all drawn from lecture material rather than the textbook. Midterms are curved, the final is not. Expect 8 to 10 hours a week outside class.

======================================================================
**Chunk 3**  |  source: course_math_220_workload.txt#0  |  produced by: chunker.py::split_documents
======================================================================
Workload for MATH 220 Linear Algebra

People keep asking so: 6 to 8 hours a week, almost all of it on problem sets. That's real time, not optimistic time. It's front-loaded — the first month is heavier than the rest, partly because you're learning the format.

======================================================================
**Chunk 4**  |  source: dining_the_ridgeway_cafe_followup.txt#0  |  produced by: chunker.py::split_documents
======================================================================
Re: The Ridgeway Café

Adding to what people have said about The Ridgeway Café. The wait figure of 10 to 15 minutes at 12:30 matches what I've seen. If you're trying to eat between classes, go before 11:45 and it's a different building entirely. Also worth saying: seating is tight; about 40 seats for a building of 900. Nobody tells you this at orientation.

======================================================================
**Chunk 5**  |  source: housing_morrow_house.txt#0  |  produced by: chunker.py::split_documents
======================================================================
Morrow House — what it's actually like

Just finished a year in this building. Built 1954, partially renovated 2008. Rooms are singles and doubles, hall bathrooms. The good: cheapest housing tier by about $900 a year, and the singles are real singles. The bad: known damp problem on the ground floor; two rooms were taken offline in 2024. Laundry costs $1.50 wash, $1.25 dry, coin or card.

## Sample Answer

<!-- One complete question and answer, pasted as text, with the source line
     visible. Milestone 4. -->

**Question:** "Where is the Pellew Dining Hall?"

**Answer:** Pellew Dining Hall is located next to the athletics centre and is described as the furthest hall from anywhere.   (best distance 0.301, cutoff 0.45)
Source: `dining_pellew_dining_hall.txt` (and also mentioned in `dining_pellew_dining_hall_followup.txt`).

**My relevance cutoff:** 

<!-- The number you set in config.py, and how you got there.

     You ran five questions your corpus covers and the five in OUT_OF_SCOPE
     that it clearly doesn't, and wrote down the best distance for each. What
     did those two groups look like? Where was the gap? Put the actual numbers
     here — the table below wants all ten rows.

     Milestone 4. --> I decided to cutoff at 0.45 given that most answers I got where under 0.4. I believe that given the way I'm configuring the chunks any higher value might not be an accurate answer because most chunks would have all the information needed.

| Question | In corpus? | Best distance |
|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |

## How I Used AI

<!-- Two specific moments. For each: what you asked for, what came back, and
     what you changed about it.

     "I asked Claude to write the chunking function from my notes. It ignored
     the overlap, so I added that myself" is the level of detail we're after.
     "I used AI to help me code" is not.

     Milestone 5. --> 

**1.** I asked Claude for a way to split my documents into sentences. Its
first suggestion was splitting on every "." — but when I tested it against
my own documents, it cut "$12.00" into "$12" and "00 cash," and did the same
to GPA values like 1.7. I asked for a fix, and it gave me a regex that only
splits after a period followed by whitespace, so a period inside a number
doesn't count. I used it as-is after checking it against a few of my own
price and GPA values to confirm it held.

**2.** I asked Claude to help me decide a chunk size and write a chunker that
doesn't cut sentences in half. It measured my documents, found that at the
starter's default of 800 characters nothing in my corpus ever splits, and
wrote a function that packs whole sentences up to a size limit instead.

# Unit 2

<!-- These sections get ADDED to what's already above. Don't delete or rewrite
     unit 1 — the point is that someone can see what you said before you knew
     how it went. -->

## Run Log — Before

<!-- Your five criteria, three runs each. `python run_eval.py --label before`
     runs the questions, puts the OUT_OF_SCOPE ones through the gate, and
     writes it all into results/ for you. Targets come from criteria.md; the
     verdict column is your call.

     Criterion 3 is measured in one deterministic pass rather than three, so
     the same number goes in all three run columns. That's correct, not lazy.

     Milestone 1. -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 2. Every answer names a source | 5 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

<!-- Underneath, paste the REAL output for each criterion from one of your
     runs — the actual text your system produced, not a description of it.
     Name the file and function that produced it. -->

## Verdicts

<!-- MET or MISSED for each of the five, against the target you wrote last
     unit — not a new one. Plus a sentence on how you decided. That sentence
     matters most where it was close.

     If your target said 4 of 5 and your runs came out 4, 3, 4, that's a MISS.
     The target has to hold, not show up occasionally.

     Milestone 2. -->

| # | Criterion | Verdict | How I decided |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |

## Diagnoses

<!-- For each miss: which stage caused it, and how. The stage alone isn't
     enough — you need the mechanism.

     Not a diagnosis: "Question 3 didn't work."
     A diagnosis:     "Question 3 asks about laundry costs. The answer is in
                       one sentence that got split across two chunks, so
                       neither chunk on its own contains it."

     The five stages: loading → chunking → embedding → retrieval → generation.

     Look for a pattern. If three misses all ask about numbers, that's one
     problem, not three.

     Missed nothing? Say so, then say honestly whether your targets were set
     low, and which one you'd tighten and to what.

     Milestone 3. -->

## The Improvement

**What I changed:**

**Why I picked it:**

<!-- Connect it to a specific diagnosis above in one sentence. If you can't,
     you picked a fix because it sounded impressive. -->

### Run Log — After

<!-- Same format, same five criteria, three runs each.
     `python run_eval.py --label after` -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 2. Every answer names a source | 5 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

**Did it help?**

<!-- Say plainly whether it did, and how you know. If it made things worse,
     say that — a change that backfired, honestly reported, earns full credit
     and is more interesting than one that worked. What matters is that you can
     tell.

     Milestone 4. -->

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each criterion still missed after your fix: what you'd do about it,
     and why you stopped where you did.

     "I ran out of time" is fine if it's true. Pretending nothing is left is
     not.

     Milestone 5. -->

## What I'd Do Differently

<!-- Knowing what you know now — which of your five criteria would you write
     differently, and why?

     Milestone 5. -->
